				Today, Lady lives with her mom, dad and cat brother Jagger in New Jersey. Although some things like elevators were really scary at first, Lady has adjusted to modern pet life quickly. Lady loves wrestling at the dog park with her friends, taking obedience class, riding the train to go to the office with her dad and going hiking on weekends. Even better, Lady's puppies were all adopted to other New York City-area families so sometimes she gets to meet up and play with them! See the <a href="puppies.html">Puppies</a> section for more information on Lady's adorable babies.
